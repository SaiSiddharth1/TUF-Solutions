## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a weighted and directed graph of V vertices and E edges. An edge is represented as [ai, bi, wi], meaning there is a directed edge from a_i to b_i having weight w_i. Find the **shortest distance** of all the vertices from the source vertex S. If a vertex can't be reached from the S then mark the distance as 10^9.

If the graph contains a negative cycle then return -1 in a list.

### Example 1:

**Input:** V = 6, Edges = [[3, 2, 6], [5, 3, 1], [0, 1, 5], [1, 5, -3], [1, 2, -2], [3, 4, -2], [2, 4, 3]], S = 0

**Output:** 0 5 3 3 1 2

**Explanation:**

For node 1, shortest path is 0->1 (distance=5).

For node 2, shortest path is 0->1->2 (distance=3)

For node 3, shortest path is 0->1->5->3 (distance=3)

For node 4, shortest path is 0->1->5->3->4 (distance=1)

For node 5, shortest path is 0->1->5 (distance=2)

### Example 2:

**Input:** V = 2, Edges = [[0,1,9]],&nbsp;S = 0

**Output:** 0 9

**Explanation:** For node 1, the shortest path is 0->1 (distance=9)

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ V ≤ 500
- 1 ≤ E ≤ V*(V-1)
- -1000 ≤ edges[i][3] ≤ 1000
- 0 ≤ S < V
